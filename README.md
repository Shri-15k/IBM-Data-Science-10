This Capstone project is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization. It consolidates all the skills learned throughout the specialization into a practical, hands-on project.

ðŸ“„ Project Overview

SpaceX has revolutionized the commercial space industry by making space travel more affordable. The Falcon 9 rocket, which costs approximately $62 million per launch, significantly reduces costs compared to other providers charging around $165 million per launch. A key factor in cost reduction is reusability, specifically the successful landing of the first stage.

The objective of this project is to predict the likelihood of the first-stage landing using machine learning models. By analyzing publicly available data, we aim to understand the factors influencing reusability and determine the most effective classification algorithm.

ðŸ“„ Research Questions

How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits affect the success of the first-stage landing?

Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?

Which classification algorithm is best suited for predicting first-stage landing success?
